# Edamam API projetc.

## Purpose of the project

This project is to create a website where the user can input ingredients they have at home and the interface will retrieve some recipes based on the ingredients for them. The communication is done using the Edamam API where a **GET** command will collect the recipes from the API and retrieve to the user.
